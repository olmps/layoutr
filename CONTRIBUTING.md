There is no rocket science to contributing to this project. Just open your issue or pull request if needed - but please be descriptive!

To submit a PR, follow [these useful guidelines](https://gist.github.com/MarcDiethelm/7303312), respect the dartfmt lint (modifications/exceptions may be discussed), and create an awesome description so we can understand it.

Even though there is no "rules" to how you should contribute, there goes my quick tips on it:

- If you're experiencing a bug that can be demonstrated visually, please take screenshots and post them alongside the issue;
- For a quicker/seamless understanding of the issue, please post a sample project, so the evaluation will be bulletproof;
- This is a git overall tip - do atomic commits with a descriptive message (no more than 50 characters is ideal).
